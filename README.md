# Multilingual App Toolkit (**MAT**) translation provider sample using TAUS DATA APIs.

The Multilingual App Toolkit supported the addition of 3rd party translation providers.  This allows connecting the workflow provided by the toolkit to your favorite translation service or even create your own in-house translation memory.

Creating a translation provider is as simple as implementing the ITranslationProvider methods found in Microsoft.Multilingual.Translation.dll.  This sample provider uses the TAUS DATA APIs to demonstrate specific details and usage requirements to create a provider that integrates with the [Microsoft App Toolkit] (http://aka.ms/matinstall).
